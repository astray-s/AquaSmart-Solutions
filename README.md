# AquaSmart Solutions: AI-Powered Water Sustainability

This website uses several features to promote water sustainability. It first obtains necessary information from the user about their water usage, such as their shower duration, toilet flushes, and their dishwasher cycles. It will then calculate the average usage for each of these functions and then multiply it by the user’s inputs to get their average water usage. The website will then take the user’s water usage and then compare it to the average usage in their zip code. The website will also have an AI that will provide guidance to the user on how to change their water usage habits and promote a sustainable environment. 
**Note**
For this project, we are not using the exact values of the average water usage for the zip codes, but instead arbitrary values.
