# AquaSmart Solutions: AI-Powered Water Sustainability

The system brings together a range of tools aimed at promoting water conservation. To start with it collects information about how much water the user uses, such as shower durations, how often the dishwasher is used, the area code of the location and the size of the household. Using this information the system calculates how much water is typically used for each activity and incorporates the users usage habits to figure out their average water consumption. It then compares the users water usage to what's typically used in their local area. Additionally there is an assistant, on the platform that gives personalized suggestions to help users adjust their water usage habits and contribute to environmental sustainability.
